# Eye-Disease-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
This project builds a CNN model to classify retinal images into four categories: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma. The dataset includes around 1000 images per class from sources like IDRiD and HRF. The goal is to aid in early detection and treatment planning for retinal diseases.
